# Content-first development model
Nuemark is a rich content format for crafting all sorts of web content like marketing pages, documentation, and blog entries. creators. You'll move faster by focusing more time on content and less time on programming:

! video: heroic | nuemark

You can enrich your basic Markdown with responsive images, videos, buttons, tabs, grids, and whatnot. With Nuemark your content is more accessible to content creators and other non-technical people. They can craft new pages without ever leaving the content.


## Custom tags
Nuemark extends standard Markdown with custom and build-in components or "tags". Here's a simplle `[image]` component in action:

``` md
[image hello.png width="500"]
```

Components are defined on a new line and are wrapped inside square brackets. They start with a tag name (image) followed with one or more arguments. The arguments have a name and value (width="500") and the default argument can be unnamed (hello.png). The default argument is specific to a component.

The component syntax is similar to other Markdown elements like images and links. WordPress users might also be delighted because the syntax takes a lot of inspiration from WP shortcodes. It's also similar to block syntax in TOML configuration format.


### Class names and id
Class names and id can be provided with `#id.foo.bar` notation after the component name:

``` md
[image#hero.epic.bordered hero.png]
```

All components support the this notation.


### Complex arguments
You can alternatively supply the data in YAML format:

``` md
[image.tall loading="eager"]
  caption: This is the image caption
  srcset: planet.png 450w, planet-big.png 900w
  sizes: (max-width: 600px) 450px, 900px
  alt: This is the alt text
```

The data must be indended right after the tag. You can mix both inline arguments and YAML data. If you are familiar with Markdown front matter, you should feel at home with configuring your components with YAML.


### The `!` alias
The `[image]`, `[video]`, and `[icon]` can alternatively be defined with a short-form `!` alias:

``` md
[! hello.png]
```

The component implementation depends on the file extension. Video formats, like `.mp4` use the video component and image formats like `.jpg` and `.webp` use the image component, and icon component is used when there is no extension. For example:

``` md
[! star]
```


## Content blocks
Components can also accept content in their body. For example, our image component accepts inline Markdown within the body, which becomes the caption for the image:

``` md
[! hello.png ]
  This content block goes under a nested <figcaption> element.
  Inline *formatting* is supported.
```

Sometimes the block just acts as a content wrapper with a class name in which case the component name can be omitted:

``` md
[.info]
  ### Note
  This is a content block with nested *Nuemark*

  [! hello.svg]
```


### Stacks and grids
The content of a component can be split into blocks with `---`

``` md
[.cards]
  ## First content block
  ---
  ## Second content block
  ---
  ## Third content block
```

The above generates this HTML:

```
<section class="cards">
  <div><h2>First content block</h2></div>
  <div><h2>First content block</h2></div>
  <div><h2>First content block</h2></div>
</section>
```

Use semantic class names like "stack" or "grid" to create layouts with any amount complexity using CSS `flexbox`, `grid`, and the `:nth-child` selector. A selector such as `.cards > div` can give the individual items a desired look.


! sample-grid.svg


Modern CSS is an undervalued powerhouse for styling semantic elements. Especially with [Lightning CSS](//lightningcss.dev/), which lets you use native CSS nesting and color functions today. Nue starts using Lightning CSS automatically if you run the following inside your project directory:

``` sh
bun add lightningcss
```


## Sections
Just like books can be divided into chapters, web pages and blog posts are often divided into sections. For example, the Nuemark demo application is separated in two: a "hero" section, and the rest of the page:


[media]
  small: /img/nuemark-sections.png
  large: /img/nuemark-sections-big.jpg
  class: tall
  width: 450

You can separate sections with three dashes (`---`) on the root-level:


```
# Hero section
Describe the hero of the article

---

## Second section
Describe something else
```

The above results to following HTML:

```
<section>
  <h2>Hero section</h2>
  <p>Describe the hero of the article</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Second section</h2>
  <p>Describe the hero of the article</p>
</section>
```





### Section class names and id
You can provide class names and id for sections with `#id.foo.bar` notation after the separator:

``` md
--- .features
```

You can alternatively define sections in the front matter:

```
sections: [.hero, .features]
```

Of course, the section definitions can also be given globally in `site.yaml` or folder level in `app.yaml`.



## Interactive components
Some of the components, like `[tabs]` are [progressively enhanced](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement) with standard [Web Components](//developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components).

``` md
[tabs "First | Second | Third"]

  ## First tab
  With full Nuemark support

  [! image1.webp]

  ---
  ## Second tab

  [! image2.webp]

  ---
  ## Third tab

  [! image3.webp]
```

Interactive components work out of the box with Nue framework. Check [Nuemark API docs](../reference/nuemark-api.html) to get the Web Components working outside Nue.


## Custom components
You can define custom components on the [layout.html](../reference/layout-components.html) file on root level or app level. For example:


```
<form @name="contact-form" action="/api/people">
  <h4>Your name</h4>
  <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Example: John Doe" required>

  <h4>Your email</h4>
  <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="your@email.com" required>

  <p><button>Join list</button></p>
</form>
```

After this you can use it on your Markdown like any of the build-in tags:


``` md
[contact-form#contact.overlaid]
```

## Markdown extensions
Nuemark extends standard Markdown syntax as follows:

### Header IDs
Nuemark outputs headers (h1, h2, h3) with a nested anchor tag. For example `## Hello` is rendered as:

```
<h2 id="hello"><a href="#hello"></a> Hello</h2>
```

This allows better styling and achoring of headers. Similar to what you can see on this page for example. You can customize the id with `{# custom_id }` suffix. For example:


```
## Building content-first applications with Nue { #content-first }
```


### Reference links
You can define reference links or "reflinks" anywhere inside the page. Links defined on one section work on any other section. For example:

```
Check out the [great divide][divide]

---

[divide]: //css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/ "JS devs vs UX devs"
```

You can also define site-wide reflinks on `site.yaml`, application level links in `app.yaml`, and page level links on the front matter using the `links` property. For example

``` yaml
# site.yaml: these reflinks works on all pages
links:
  issues: //github.com/nuejs/nue/issues "Nue Github Issues"
  divide: //css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/ "JS devs vs UX devs"
  front: //bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/
```

[.info]
  #### Note
  Nue hot-reloading updates the page correctly no matter where the reflink is defined.


### Fenced code blocks
Fenced code blocks can be extended with `language-name#foo.bar` notation. For example:

~~~
``` html.bordered
<!-- My code goes here -->
```
~~~

Will pass "html" for the underlying code highlighter and the wrapper looks like this:

```
<pre class="syntax-html bordered">
  ...
</pre>
```


[.info]
  #### Note
  A Nue-optimized syntax highlighter will be released on the next version of Nuemark.


### Line comments
Line comments are prefixed with `//`

```
// This line is a comment and thus not rendered
# Hello, World
```



### Always draw sections
Setting `draw_sections: true` makes Nuemark wrap the page inside `<section>` tag even if there are no sections defined on the page. Setting this globally makea consistent HTML structure for your external CSS.
